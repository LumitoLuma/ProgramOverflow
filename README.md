## Uses of this tool
1.  Test your VM speed and durability.
2.  Destroy it!

## Building source code
1.  `git clone` the repository or download it using download button.

## FAQ

-   Is Program Overflow good for my computer?

    ► Well... I would not enable the dangerous features on a **real computer**, but if you do not enable them, I think the program is **safe**. However, I am not responsible of any damage this tool can make to your computer.

-   I have seen that the image of this text document has features that the program I download through releases does not have. How can I get them?

    ► Currently are **under development**. You can always download the "latest latest" version of Program Overflow **through my downloads website**.

-   How can I try this program safely?

    ► You can try it safely using a **virtual machine**. A good free one is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), but the best (paid) is [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html).
