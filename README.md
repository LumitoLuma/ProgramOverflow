# Lumito's Program Overflow
Program Overflow is an utility that makes lots of copies of it to later run them. It's DANGEROUS!!! Please use it in a VM.
I'm not responsible of any damage this tool can make to your computer. Use it at your own risk.

## Uses of this tool
1.  Test your VM speed and durability.
2.  Destroy it!

## Building source code
1.  `git clone` the repository or download it using download button.
2.  Use `MSBuild` to build the repository. If you use the `MSBuild` that is included in .NET framework 4.0 or above, you'll just to run `msbuild /m` to compile it. If you use Visual Studio's `MSBuild` you'll need to run `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"` to build it.
3.  Check the bin\Debug or Release folder and search for Program Overflow executable.
4.  Done!!! Enjoy using Lumito's Program Overflow!
