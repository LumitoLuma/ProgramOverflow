# Lumito's Program Overflow
Program Overflow is an utility that makes lots of copies of it to later run them. It's DANGEROUS!!! Please use it in a VM.
I'm not responsible of any damage this tool can make to your computer. Use it at your own risk.

## Uses of this tool:
1. Test your VM speed and durability.
2. Destroy it!

## Building source code:
1. `git clone` the repository or download it using download button.
2. Use `msbuild` to build the rrepostory. If you use the `msbuild` that is included in .NET framework 4.8, you'll just to run `msbuild` to compile it. If you use Visual Studio's `msbuild` you'll need to run `msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"` to build it.
3. Check the bin\Debug or Release folder and search for Program Overflow executable.
4. Done!!! Enjoy using Lumito's Program Overflow!
